Dynamic e-commerce created with HTML, CSS, Javascript, HandleBars, MongoDB, Node.js and Express.js. Base structure is made with Bootstrap, Node.js and Express.js. Client side is redered using Handelbars.js. Persistance was obtained thanks to MongoDB and Mongoose. Authorization and Authentication also works but with new users.


 Note -> node_modules is uncomplete, so they have to be downloaded again to run the web.
